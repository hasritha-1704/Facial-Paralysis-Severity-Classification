Title: "Severity Assessment of Facial Paralysis using Transfer Learning and Ensemble Learning Approaches"

Abstract: 
      "Facial paralysis is a significant medical condition that can severely impact a patient's quality of life. 
      Timely and accurate prediction of the severity of facial paralysis can facilitate appropriate treatment planning and improve patient outcomes. 
      There are many machine learning models implemented using the data extracted from the image datasets and simple deep learning models using the 
      image data which had certain limitations like model overfitting, less performance, high computational costs and lack of interpretability. 
      This project focuses on predicting the severity of facial paralysis using transfer learning and ensemble learning techniques on the images directly. 
      We utilized pre-trained CNN models, including MobileNetV3_Small, ShuffleNetV2_X0, ShuffleNetV2_X1, SqueezeNet1_0, SqueezeNet1_1, and GoogleNet, 
      fine-tuned to classify the severity into four categories: Mild, Moderate, Normal, and Severe. The data is collected from YouTube facial paralysis 
      dataset of videos and MTCNN is applied on those videos to extract images. An ensemble model leveraging the strengths of individual models through 
      majority voting is implemented to improve performance and robustness, which demonstrates the potential of these approaches in medical image 
      classification tasks, potentially enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning in clinical practice."


We have used the Youtube Facial Palsy (YFP) video dataset for this task. The Video dataset is converted into image dataset using MTCNN model.
